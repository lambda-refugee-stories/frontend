## Editing Instructions

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
>`create-react-app` comes with certain dependencies, but more will need to be added before the project will compile.

To successfully launch this application, the following must be entered into the terminal:

1. `cd` into the proper directory, and then `cd` into the `stories` folder.

2. `yarn install` will instarn yarn, which is used to add dependencies.

3. `yard add react-router-dom axios reactstrap bootstrap node-sass` will add the necessary dependencies to run this application.

> To break this down further:
> * `react-router-dom` is used for all of the routing, including but not limited to: Links, Routes, BrowserRouter and withRouter.
> * `axios` is an HTTP client that can be used for CRUD operations.
> * `reactstrap bootstrap` allow for easier CSS and animations.
> * `node-sass` allows for the use of Sass, which is a CSS preprocessor.

4. `yarn start` will run the application in development mode, and the webpage should load at http://localhost:3000 in the browser. You're all set to edit this project!
